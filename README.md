# Evil-Josephus
The solution to the famous Josephus problem using data structures(circular linked list), bad english and good programming! 
The solution implemented here is for a modified version of the josephus problem wherein N soldiers are sitting in a circle and
their execution needs to be carried out. One of the soldiers is selected as the starting head. He is spared at the start and K 
no of soldiers are skipped and the immediate next is killed. For example: If no 1 is the start and soldiers to skip are 3 then
for a group of 5 soldiers the order in which they are killed is 5->4->1->3 and 2 survives!. Jospehus needs to find out where he
must sit in order to survive. Now I don't know whether he survived or died but if he had this program, he surely would have
survived. HueHueHue
